# YOLO Object Detection on Business Certificate

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

This repository contains code for performing object detection on business certificates using YOLO (You Only Look Once). The primary goal is to demonstrate how to train a YOLO model for detecting specific fields on business certificates, such as date of birth, business name, business address, and more. With this YOLO model, you can efficiently extract essential information from documents with a consistent format.

## Introduction

The YOLO Object Detection model in this repository is trained to identify and provide bounding boxes for specific fields on business certificates. This can be a powerful tool for automating data extraction from documents that have a consistent format. You can also adapt this approach for various use cases, such as extracting signatures from checks or retrieving the name of an account holder.

## Demo Images

Here are some example images that demonstrate the YOLO model's ability to detect and crop specific fields on a business certificate.
